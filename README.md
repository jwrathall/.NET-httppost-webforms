HTTPPost_CSharp_WebFroms
========================

While working on a webforms project I needed to make an ajax call in which I wanted to use http verbs. Webforms and the 
version of .net I as using doesn't really work too well with what I wanted to do. An xml web service wasn't in the cards.

This snippet was the solution I found to achieve json being returned from webforms.
